# wallet_core_bindings
Dart bindings for [Trust Wallet Core](https://github.com/trustwallet/wallet-core), used in Flutter and Dart.

## Features

- TrustWalletCore include files and Protobuf file bindings.
- Provides Native and WebAssembly System Interface, supporting all platforms.
- APIs are repackaged for easier use.
- Combined with Dart GC, there is no need to control memory.
- Update the TrustWalletCore version synchronously and keep the APIs consistent.

## Usage
There are two ways to use wallet_core_bindings, Native and Web Assembly. Please follow the instructions below to make your choice.

### Native
The native features of the platform rely on the dynamic library compiled by [Wallet Core](https://github.com/trustwallet/wallet-core), Binding with [dart:ffi](https://dart.dev/interop/c-interop).
* wallet_core_bindings_libs contains native dynamic libraries. Currently, only Android and iOS are supported. Due to the diversity of CPU architectures, Linux and macOS can be compiled and added to the project by themselves. It is possible that subsequent versions will find suitable ways to support them. Windows is not supported at present.
```yaml
dependencies:
  wallet_core_bindings: version
  wallet_core_bindings_native: version
  wallet_core_bindings_libs: version
```
```dart
import 'package:wallet_core_bindings/wallet_core_bindings.dart';
import 'package:wallet_core_bindings_native/wallet_core_bindings_native.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await WalletCoreBindingsNativeImpl().initialize();
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```
### Web Assembly
Build WalletCore for WASMï¼ŒBinding with [wasm_run](https://github.com/juancastillo0/wasm_run).
* It is suitable for use on platforms that do not support native, such as Web and Windows. However, wasm itself has strong cross-platform features and is not limited to these two platforms.
```yaml
dependencies:
  wasm_run_flutter: version
  wallet_core_bindings: version
  wallet_core_bindings_wasm: version
  wallet_core_bindings_wasm_assets: version
```
```dart
import 'package:wallet_core_bindings/wallet_core_bindings.dart';
import 'package:wallet_core_bindings_wasm/wallet_core_bindings_wasm.dart';
import 'package:wasm_run_flutter/wasm_run_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await WasmRunLibrary.setUp(override: false);
  await WalletCoreBindingsWasmImpl().initialize();
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

## Generate

### Protobuf
Refer to the TrustWalletCore build [documentation](https://developer.trustwallet.com/developer/wallet-core/developing-the-library/building) and complete the steps to generate files. Extract proto files in src/proto and use [protoc_plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/protoc_plugin) to compile them into Dart code.

```shell
cd ../proto/TrustWalletCore/
protoc --dart_out=../../wallet_core_bindings/lib/proto/ ./*
```
